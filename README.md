## Manachers Algorithm

This repository dives into the Manachers Algorithm, a versatile linear-time algorithm for identifying palindromic substrings within a string. 

**What is the Manachers Algorithm?**

The Manachers Algorithm efficiently determines the length of the longest palindrome centered at each character in a given string. This allows it to locate all palindromes within the string, making it valuable for tasks like palindrome detection and analysis.

**Project Implementations:**
