## Palindrome Finder

This project aims to create a professional-grade palindrome finder utilizing the Manachers Algorithm. It empowers users to identify all palindromes within a text string, presenting results in a clear and informative manner.

**Features:**

* **Efficient Algorithm:** Leverages the Manachers Algorithm for fast and accurate palindrome detection.
* **User-Friendly Input:** Accepts text input from the user through a command-line interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
* **Comprehensive Output:** Displays the starting index, length, and the actual palindrome string for each identified palindrome.
* **Flexibility:** Offers options for handling special characters or spaces within the input string (e.g., removal, conversion).
* **Error Handling:** Provides informative messages for invalid input or unexpected errors.

**Implementation:**

1. **Preprocessing (Optional):**
   - The user has the option to choose how to handle special characters and spaces within the text string. A configuration menu or command-line arguments can be used to specify the desired behavior (e.g., remove, convert to a specific character).
   - The chosen preprocessing function is applied to the user-provided text string.

2. **Manachers Algorithm Integration:**
   - The core functionality relies on the Manachers Algorithm. 
   - The algorithm iterates through each character in the preprocessed string, expanding outwards to find the longest palindrome centered at that character.
   - An auxiliary array (`P`) is used to store the "palindrome lengths" for each position, facilitating efficient palindrome identification.

3. **Palindrome Extraction:**
   - Based on the values in the `P` array, the function extracts the actual palindrome substrings.
   - For each valid palindrome (`P[i] > 0`), the starting index (`(i - P[i]) // 2`) and length (`P[i]`) are used to retrieve the corresponding substring from the original (preprocessed) text string.

4. **Output:**
   - The function presents the identified palindromes in a clear and well-formatted manner.
   - Each palindrome is displayed with its starting index, length, and the actual palindrome string itself.

**Enhancements:**

* **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Develop a user-friendly GUI for easier interaction. Users can input text, choose preprocessing options, and view results in a visually appealing format.
* **Regular Expression Support:** Integrate regular expressions to enable more complex search patterns within the input string. This allows users to search for specific types of palindromes (e.g., alphanumeric only).
* **Performance Optimization:** Explore techniques for further performance optimization, especially when dealing with very large text datasets.
